I am a Ph.D. candidate at the **School of Cyberspace Science and Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University**, 
affiliated with the **Key Laboratory of Big Data & Artificial Intelligence in Transportation (MOE)**, 
supervised by **Prof. Yidong Li**.

My research focuses on **Machine Unlearning and Federated Learning**, with particular interests in 
**prototype-based unlearning**, **transmission-efficient unlearning for AIoT**, and 
**privacy and security issues in trustworthy AI systems**.

Currently, I am working on:
- Federated Machine Unlearning via prototype distillation
- Transmission-friendly unlearning for pretrained language models
- Privacy analysis in federated learning (e.g., prototype behavior and distribution shift)

I have published papers in **IEEE TSC, IEEE TNSE**, and international conferences, 
and currently have manuscripts under review at **IEEE TKDE** and **IEEE TSC**.
